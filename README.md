Predict the Next Word in Sentence using Neural Networks
Abstract 
The aim of the project is to predict the next word in a sentence; it is also known as "language modeling." It plays a major role in NLP applications like text summarization and the translation of questions and answers into various languages. In general, a language model will take as input a raw text corpus, and the probabilities of each word in the data will be calculated to find the similarity distance between them. This text corpus is split into two portions: 70% of training data and 30% of test data. For this problem, we are now solving it by using neural networks for language modeling. The three techniques, which are RNN (recurrent neural network), LSTM (long short-term memory), and Bi-LSTM (bi-directional long short-term memory), are combined with training data. It can be trained for up to 20 epochs and evaluated with test data to determine accuracies for models. Finally, using test cases as examples, it predicts the next word of the  sentence. Note: The next word is either a word or the continuation letters of a word.
